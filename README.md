## 📊 About the Project

This project uses the **Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset** to build a **Logistic Regression** model that predicts whether a patient is diabetic. It includes:

* Data preprocessing
* Model training and evaluation
* Confusion matrix visualization
* Interactive prediction based on user input

---

## 🚀 Features

* ✅ Logistic Regression-based binary classification
* 🔍 Real-time predictions from user input
* 📈 Accuracy, confusion matrix & classification report
* 🧾 User-friendly CLI with emojis for better UX

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Python 3.x
* pandas
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib
* seaborn
